## SwiftUI

This is just a fun side project to play with SwiftUI. It's a single screen application so there is not much going on but is interesting to play with nonetheless. You won't find ViewModels or any fancy architecture, and this is a conscious decisions. Is nice to keep things simple for once ðŸ˜‚
